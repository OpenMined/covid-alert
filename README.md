## Getting `app` to work

The dashboard and package directories mostly speak for themselves. To get the app to run, run the following lines:

1. `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. `react-native link` to add assets (fonts and images) to packages
3. If you want to install ios, run `cd ios && pod install && cd ../`
4. `yarn start` for hot reloading
5. iOS: `yarn ios` / Android: `yarn android`
